WARNING: `ColorTwist` is now deprecated. Use `Hsv/BrightnessContrast` instead
[/opt/dali/dali/operators/color/color_twist.h:181] The Operators: `ColorTwist`, `Hue`, `Saturation`, `Brightness`, `Contrast`, are deprecated, not supported, and will be removed in version 0.20. Please use `BrightnessContrast` and `Hsv` instead.

Selected optimization level O2:  FP16 training with FP32 batchnorm and FP32 master weights.

Defaults for this optimization level are:
enabled                : True
opt_level              : O2
cast_model_type        : torch.float16
